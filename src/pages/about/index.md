    specialties:
      - Trauma and PTSD
      - Depression
      - Bipolar Disorder
    body: I use a psychodynamic approach to help my clients achieve stable mental
      health. Our work will focus on building supportive relationships. Having
      positive, meaningful relationships is the key to human health and success.
      Everyone deserves to feel they belong and are accepted for who they are.
      We will work together in a safe, non-judgmental space; I accept all people
      unconditionally. Whether you suffer from relationship troubles, bullying,
      anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, paranoia or another
      trauma, therapy can help. If you need someone to talk to, I will listen. I
      specialize in working with people suffer from PTSD, depression, bi-polar
      disorder and anxiety. I use psychodynamic techniques for deep seated
      troubles/trauma. I practice mindfulness meditation to train the brain by
      focusing on the breath, and letting go of thoughts and worries. I work
      with adults, children, and adolescents--of all genders, all cultures, all
      ages, all races, all abilities, and all ethnicities from any and all
      countries of origin. I believe psychotherapy and meditation can help
      relieve you from anxiety and suffering. With children, I use
      child-centered play therapy, sand tray therapy, and acting and art.
