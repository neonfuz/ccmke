    name: Sarah La Follette, LCSW
    phone: (414) 322-2807
    email: LaFolletteSarah@gmail.com
    specialties:
      - Trauma and PTSD
      - Depression
      - Bipolar Disorder
    body: I use a psychodynamic approach to help my clients achieve stable mental
      health. Our work will focus on building supportive relationships. Having
      positive, meaningful relationships is the key to human health and success.
      Everyone deserves to feel they belong and are accepted for who they are.
      We will work together in a safe, non-judgmental space; I accept all people
      unconditionally. Whether you suffer from relationship troubles, bullying,
      anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, paranoia or another
      trauma, therapy can help. If you need someone to talk to, I will listen. I
      specialize in working with people suffer from PTSD, depression, bi-polar
      disorder and anxiety. I use psychodynamic techniques for deep seated
      troubles/trauma. I practice mindfulness meditation to train the brain by
      focusing on the breath, and letting go of thoughts and worries. I work
      with adults, children, and adolescents--of all genders, all cultures, all
      ages, all races, all abilities, and all ethnicities from any and all
      countries of origin. I believe psychotherapy and meditation can help
      relieve you from anxiety and suffering. With children, I use
      child-centered play therapy, sand tray therapy, and acting and art.

      “ Hope” is the thing with feathers – That perches in the soul – And sings
      the tune without the words-and never stops at all.” Emily Dickinson


      Hope begins the journey of becoming the person we are meant to be. With positive, unconditional regard, and someone who listens, we take comfort in being. We humans beautifully gravitate towards health and Improving our lives.


      I’m passionate about being part of each persons’ journey, focusing on each individual’s strengths and history. I look for the good in everyone. Every person is worthy of being heard and accepted for who he, she or they are.


      I’m nurturing, kind, creative and intuitive. My clients develop a sense of curiosity and humor—amidst good times and bad.


      In addition to working with adults, I do Theraplay, a modality that builds positive, warm, relationships between parent and child. It increases communication, and allows both parent and child to self regulate.


      I facilitate Jungian Sand Tray Therapy with adults and children. It is a modality that creates a safe and sacred space that allows individuals to work through issues in a sensory, emotional, and non verbal way.


      I facilitate child centered Play Therapy, which, like Sand Tray Therapy, the direction of the therapy is determined by the client. I also use Bibliotherapy with some children to help them understand whatever they are working through by reading them books about others dealing with the similar problems.
